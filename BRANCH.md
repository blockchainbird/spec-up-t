The purpose of this branch is to test an implementation of the possibility of adding local aliases to trefs.

Currently:

```markdown
[[tref: keri1, keris-algorithm-for-witness-agreement]]
```

New situation:

```markdown
[[tref: keri1, keris-algorithm-for-witness-agreement, kafwa]]
```

where `kafwa` is a free to choose string, and can be used as follows:

```markdown
[[def: kafwa]]
```
