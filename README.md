### Test Results
Detailed test results can be found in the GitHub Actions logs for each workflow run. Specifically, check the output of the "Run Tests (No Coverage)" job for standard test results, and the "Run Tests (With Coverage)" job for tests run with coverage enabled.

### Test Coverage
A summary of the test coverage is available in the GitHub Actions logs for the "Run Tests (With Coverage)" job, within the output of its "Run Jest tests and coverage" step. Currently, detailed coverage reports are not uploaded as artifacts, so the logs are the primary place to view this information.
